\noindent
We study higher symmetries and anomalies of 4d  $\so(2n_c)$ gauge theory with $N_f=2n_f$ flavors.
We find that they depend on the parity of $n_c$ and $n_f$,
on the global form of the gauge group, and the discrete theta angle.
The contribution from the fermions plays a central role in our analysis.
Furthermore, our conclusion applies to \Nequals1 supersymmetric cases as well, and
we see that higher symmetries and anomalies match across the duality 
$\so(2n_c)\leftrightarrow\so(2n_f-n_c+4)$ of Intriligator and Seiberg.

\section{Introduction and summary}
\label{sec:introduction}
Our understanding of the concept of symmetries in quantum field theories has been greatly improved in the last several years.
We now have the concept of $p$-form symmetries acting on $p$-dimensional objects \cite{Gaiotto:2014kfa}.
This concept  gives a unifying point of view to both
ordinary symmetries acting on point operators for $p=0$
and center symmetries of gauge theories acting on Wilson line operators for $p=1$.
In addition, the 't Hooft magnetic flux \cite{tHooft:1979rtg} can now be thought of as a background gauge field for the 1-form center symmetry.
It is also realized more recently that 0-form symmetries and 1-form symmetries can not only coexist in a direct product but also mix in a more intricate manner.
They can have mixed anomalies between them.
They can also combine to form a symmetry structure called 2-groups \cite{Cordova:2018cvg,Benini:2018reh}.

In this paper we study these issues in the case of 4d $\so(N_c)$ gauge theories with 
$N_f$ flavors of fermion fields in vector representation.
Let us quickly recall the 0-form and 1-form symmetries these theories have.

As for the 1-form symmetry, we first need to recall that 
such theories come in three versions, $\Spin$, $\SO_+$ and $\SO_-$,
distinguished by the global form of the gauge group ($\Spin$ vs.~$\SO$)
and by the choice of a discrete theta angle ($\SO_+$ vs.~$\SO_-$) \cite{Aharony:2013hda}\footnote{%
This is when the theories are considered on spin manifolds.
On more general manifolds a further distinction needs to be made \cite{Ang:2019txy}.
For simplicity we only consider spin manifolds in this paper.
}.
They also differ by the nontrivial line operator they possess: 
the $\Spin$ theory has the Wilson line $W$ in the spinor representation,
the $\SO_+$ theory has the 't Hooft line $H$ which is mutually non-local with respect to $W$,
and the $\SO_-$ theory has the dyonic line $D=WH$. 
Furthermore, these line operators are charged under corresponding $\bZ_2$ 1-form symmetries,
which we can all electric, magnetic and dyonic 1-form symmetries.

As for the 0-form symmetry, 
we focus our attention on the $\su(N_f)$ symmetry acting on $N_f$ flavors of matter fields 
in the vector representation.
There can be and definitely are other discrete symmetries, but we will not consider them in this paper for brevity.

The main question is then how the $\bZ_2$ 1-form symmetry and the $\su(N_f)$ 0-form symmetry are related.\footnote{%
A partial answer was given in \cite{Hsin:2020nts}, but the contribution from fermions was not taken into account in that reference.
Our conclusion is therefore somewhat different from theirs.
}
We concentrate on the case when $N_c$ and $N_f$ are both even, $N_c=2n_c$ and $N_f=2n_f$.

Take for example the $Spin(2n_c)$ gauge theory with $2n_f$ flavors,
when $n_c$ is odd.
Take two copies of  the Wilson line $W$ in the spinor representation. 
They form a Wilson line in the vector representation.
This can be screened by a dynamical fermion, which was why $W^2=1$ 
as far as the 1-form symmetry charge was concerned.
Now let us recall that this dynamical fermion transforms nontrivially under $-1\in \SU(2n_f)$.
Therefore, when we take the flavor symmetry into account, $W^2$ is still nontrivial.
As we will recall below,  formally this means that the $\bZ_2$ 1-form symmetry extends the $\SU(2n_f)/\bZ_2$ 0-form symmetry in a nontrivial manner, forming a nontrivial 2-group  $H$\begin{equation}
0\to \bZ_2[1] \to H\to \SU(2n_f)/\bZ_2\to 0,\label{2-group}
\end{equation}
whose Postnikov class is specified by \begin{equation}
\beta v_2 \in H^3(\SU(2n_f)/\bZ_2,\bZ_2),\label{postnikov}
\end{equation}
where $a_2$ is the generator of $H^2(\SU(2n_f)/\bZ_2,\bZ_2)=\bZ_2$ and $\beta$ is the Bockstein.

The $\SO_+$ gauge theory is then obtained by gauging the $\bZ_2$ 1-form symmetry \cite{Kapustin:2014gua}.
The presence of the fermions significantly complicates the analysis.
For the moment let us suppose that we have $N_f$ scalars instead of fermions in the vector representation.
Then, the argument of \cite{Tachikawa:2017gyf} immediately applies, and 
we see that the $\bZ_2$ 1-form symmetry of the $\SO(2n_f)$ theory and the $\SU(2n_f)/\bZ_2$ 0-form flavor symmetry remains a direct product but with a mixed anomaly given by \begin{equation}
2\pi i \frac12 \int B\beta v_2.\label{mixed}
\end{equation}


In the rest of the paper, we will carefully analyze how the $\bZ_2$ 1-form symmetry and the $\SU(2n_f)/\bZ_2$ 0-form symmetry are combined.
The derivation will be detailed in the following, and here we simply summarize the result  in Table~\ref{table:main}.
There, `none' specifies that they remain a direct product without mixed anomaly;
`anomaly' implies that they remain a direct product but with mixed anomaly of the form \eqref{mixed};
and `extension' means that they combine into a 2-group given by \eqref{2-group} with the Postnikov class \eqref{postnikov}.

Our result is equally applicable in the case of \Nequals1 supersymmetric QCD, for which
Intriligator and Seiberg found in \cite{Intriligator:1995id} a duality exchanging $\so(N_c)$ and $\so(N_f-N_c+4)$,
which in our notation sends $n_c$ to $n_c'=n_f-n_c+2$.
In \cite{Aharony:2013hda}, this duality was refined to account for the global form of the gauge group and the discrete theta angle, and it was concluded that $\Spin$ is exchanged with $\SO_-$ while $\SO_+$ maps to itself.
This mapping was checked using supersymmetric localization on $S^3/\bZ_n \times S^1$ in \cite{Razamat:2013opa}.
Our analysis allows us to check this duality by comparing how the 1-form symmetry and the 0-form symmetry are combined in the dual pairs.
We superimposed the action of the duality on our main Table~\ref{table:main}.
It is satisfying to see that the duality action correctly preserves the labels `none', `anomaly' and `extension'.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows ...
